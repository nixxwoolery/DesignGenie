## About the Project

### Overview
DesignGenie is a personalized UX design recommendation system that translates design theory into practical suggestions. Users enter project-specific details (e.g., target audience, platform, content type), and the system outputs curated recommendations grounded in accessibility and usability standards. Itâ€™s ideal for designers, marketers, and developers seeking guided inspiration.

### Goals
The key objectives of this project included:

**User-Centered Design Guidance**
- Provide structured, research-based recommendations tailored to user goals and constraints.

**Theoretical UX Integration**
- Embed functional and inclusive UX principles into a usable interface.

**Accessible Development**
- Ensure output supports accessibility standards and usability best practices.

**Expandable Infrastructure**
- Use a database that can scale with more guidelines, user types, and rules.

## Technologies Used

### Core Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **Database:** SQLite (`design_recommendations.db`)
- **Development Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebooks

### What I Learned
- Structuring UX knowledge into a normalized schema
- Creating hybrid recommendation systems (static theory + dynamic inputs)
- Designing with accessibility in mind from the ground up
- Connecting backend logic to a clean, easy-to-navigate frontend

### Continued Development
- Implementing a color-matching tool for accessible palette recommendations
- Mapping user emotional tone or brand mood into style suggestions
- Creating real-time feedback modules or tooltips in the GUI
- Building a Figma or Sketch plugin for rapid design iteration

### The Design
This tool is built on a modular design framework:
- A user-friendly front end with contextual guidance
- A well-structured database that reflects real-world UX heuristics
- A flexible system for evolving recommendation strategies
